Introduction
==============
In the paper, [*Spatial leave-one-out cross-validation for variable selection in the presence of spatial autocorrelation*] (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12161/pdf), Le Rest and others showed that the Spatial leave-on-out (SLOO) method was better at selecting the correct model variables than AIC when the spatial range of the spatially autocorrelated data was less than sixty percent. However, this paper did not investigate the accuracy and precesion of the variable's coeffcients.

Purpose
--------------
The purpose of the code is to investigate the affect unexplained variation and spatial dependence has on the accuracy and precisions of a models beta coeffcients. In order to acomplish this, ...
